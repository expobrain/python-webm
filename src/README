Python-WebM
===========

The python-webm package is an interface to the Google WebM new video/image codec
which promise a better compression of image and video data.
The interface uses ctypes to call the libvpx/libwebm Google libraries installed
in the system.
At the moment only the libwebm library is wrapped and with some limitations.


Platforms
---------

Here a list of platforms with the current support status of the python-webm
package:

* Windows: NOT SUPPORTED YET
* Ubuntu 32bit: SUPPORTED (tested on Ubuntu 10.10)
* Ubuntu 64bit: NOT TESTED YET
* Mac OS X: SUPPORTED(tested with Python 64bit on Snow Leopard 10.6.6)


Prerequisites
-------------

Below a list of prerequisites to use the python-webm package:

* Python 2.6.5+ (http://www.python.org)
* Python nose (http://code.google.com/p/python-nose)
* libvpx from sources (http://www.webmproject.org/code/#webm-repositories)
* libwebp from sources (http://www.webmproject.org/code/#webp-repositories)
* Python PIL for some unit tests (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)

Remember to compile and install libwebp after libvpx.
To compile and/or install every library following the instructions shipped
within.


Usage
-----

At the moment only decode functions are implemented. To use those function
create a new instance of WebPDecoder() class and call its methods with the
required arguments and keywords. Read the docstrings to know about what type of
arguments and keywords are required and what type of result is returned.


Unit testing
------------

To run the unit tests you must first install the Python nose package from the
official web site http://code.google.com/p/python-nose or from PyPI (preferred)
by running:

  $ easy_install nose

Nose is a very helpful library to discover, manage and run unit tests. If you
are lazy and you want to run the tests immediately just run:

  $ nosetests -s -x

to discover and run the unit tests, without capturing the stdout (-s) and
stopping the tests at the first fail or error (-x).
